# eyehandrdk
Data analysis code for RDK experiment with eye- and hand-tracking.

Currently, the analysis is summarized in two Jupyter notebooks:

[basic psychometrics](https://github.com/cherepaha/eyehandrdk/blob/master/psychometrics.ipynb)
[initiation times](https://github.com/cherepaha/eyehandrdk/blob/master/initiation_times.ipynb)

These notebooks are in active development, and more notebooks with more advanced analyses are on the way
